	<h3 align="center"><u>TWELVE PILLAR</u></h3>
	<h4 align="center"><b> by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener</b></h4>
	<p><i>This novel focuses on Twelve Pillars of Success by breaking down fundamental principles
	that will help you to change the course of your life.<b style=" background-color:#90ee90">Chapter Four: The major reason for setting
	a goal is for what it makes of you to accomplish it.</b>In this chapter the focus was on Goals, how just writing them down
	sparks the beginning of your next destination to achieving them, no matter how the timeline whether long-term, middle or short-term
	your goals can be achieved if you write them down and make time for them.<b style="background-color:#90ee90">Chapter Five: Every day has many opportunities, but
	only one best opportunity.</b>"We all must suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret" is a line that stood out for me.
	Every day we are alive we have the opportunity to make time to achieve our goals, time we are either going to take control of ourselves or be
	controlled it by if we don't use it wisely. We shouldn't focus on what is urgent but on that what is important to 
	our future, on our development.<b style="background-color:#90ee90">Chapter Six: Don't join an easy crowd; you won't grow. Go where the 
	expectations and the demands to perform are high.</b>Who we surround ourselves with matters. It affects our development and our growth.
	Your friends determine your attitude and your attitude determines your altitude.<b style="background-color:#90ee90">Chapter Seven: Formal education will make you a living. 
	Self-education will make you a fortune.</b>What we learn here at university is just a portion of what we need to "survive" in this world.
	What we teach ourselves through reading, observation and reflection is what determines our success, and our growth.
	Learning is the beginning of wisdom and through wisdom comes great understanding. One last thing that stood out to me was this if you <b> Crystalize your goals your mind will 
	spring them into your consciousness and you will bring them into your reality.</b>
