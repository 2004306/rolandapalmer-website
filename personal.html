	<h3><strong><u>WHO AM I?</u></strong></h3>
	<p><i> My name is Rolanda Palmer. I am a first-year Computer Science Major here at the university of technology, Jamaica
	I'm 20 years of age, a Christian who is a pescatarian by choice. I like solitude, watching old-times series and romcoms, adventure, and minimalist living. My favourite colour is pink but
	I also appreciate neutral colours such as white, nude, light grey, etc. I'm shy at first but once you get to know me
	you see that I'm fun to be around. I like listening and observing my surroundings. My hobbies include reading though I don't read a lot,
	dancing, playing video games, surfing the internet and engaging in technology-related activities such as watching unboxing of the latest gadgets or watching tech reviews.I dislike excessive noise, untidiness,
	and disappointment though I know it is a part of life. I also dislike a proud, obligated character. I also dislike overly spicy food, I like to taste my food honestly.</p>
<br>
	<h3><strong><u>Personality Test</u></strong></h3>
	<img src="assets/test.png" 
	<p><srtrong><u>Reflection:</u></strong><br>According to this test I am a Guardian, which means I am humble, cautious and focused on credentials<br>
	I am dependable, helpful and hardworking, which makes me a stabilised leader. With all honesty this is true<br>
	but I would like to add that I am also easygoing at times and isn't that social so about the	leadership<br> aspect I am not so sure about that part.
